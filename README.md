# MLDA Deep Learning Week Hackathon
### mlda-dlw
This is a documentation of all our files from the project! 

## Goals
Covid-19 has caused much inconvenience in our lives and affected everyone in one way or another. The outbreak of the virus, followed by the safe distancing measures has
resulted in one of the worst economic downturn.

Known for being a technology hub, Singapore excels in using technology to improve ourselves.
We aim to leaverage on artificial intelligence to improve business continuity and economic resilience in Singapore. 
One main industry that has taken a big hit especially during the Circuit Breaker is the retail industry.
With the easing of measures, we want to further assist them to increase their business sales. 

More details are in the proposal

## Benefits
- removing the psychological barrier for shoppers to enter a retail store due to the hassle from Safe Entry
- reducing unnecessary manpower allocation at an area that's already limited by the holding capactiy
- Providing an easier contact tracing methods when phase 3 of Circuit Breaker arrives (when measures on larger events are loosen)
  This could be a possible driver for an early phase 3 as necessary technologies are available for monitoring the cases.
## Other Benefits
- More precise contact tracing with the already exisiting physical security measures

## Technology Used
#### [Google Colab](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiw2P6AsbzsAhWFheYKHTYuBsMQFjAAegQIDhAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcolab.research.google.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw3A5aPK2kLFzKOzb6sOckVw)
Our project are done on Google Colab, is not just a wonderful platform for collaboration but google also provides *free GPU* for deeplearning wowzz.
