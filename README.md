This is a documentation of all our files from the project! 

## Goals
Covid-19 has caused much inconvenience in our lives and affected everyone in one way or another. The outbreak of the virus, followed by the safe distancing measures has
resulted in one of the worst economic downturn.

Known for being a technology hub, Singapore excels in using technology to improve ourselves.
We aim to leaverage on artificial intelligence to improve business continuity and economic resilience in Singapore. 
One main industry that has taken a big hit especially during the Circuit Breaker is the retail industry.
With the easing of measures, we want to further assist them to increase their business sales. 

More details are in the proposal.

## Benefits
- Removing the psychological barrier for shoppers to enter a retail store due to the hassle from Safe Entry.
  Thus, increasing controlled traffic which generates greater sales revenue. 
- Reducing unnecessary manpower allocation at Safe Entry and freeing up labor for more important task.  
- Providing an easier contact tracing method when phase 3 of Circuit Breaker arrives.
  This could be a possible driver for an early phase 3 as necessary technologies are available for monitoring the cases.
  Thus, providing business continuity for those business that have yet to operate and a loosen measures for those already in business.
## Other Benefits
- More precise contact tracing with the already exisiting physical security hardware

## Technology Used

#### [Google Colab](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiw2P6AsbzsAhWFheYKHTYuBsMQFjAAegQIDhAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcolab.research.google.com%2F&usg=AOvVaw3A5aPK2kLFzKOzb6sOckVw)
Our project are done on Google Colab, it is not just a wonderful platform for collaboration but google also provides *free GPU* for deeplearning purposes wowzz.
